'''
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
'''

''' notes
Two number a and b
We can ignore when a = b
we can ignore when either a or b have trailing 0's
